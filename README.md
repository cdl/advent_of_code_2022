# `advent_of_code_2022`

Participating in [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) this year, and in an act of likely regrettable hubris, I've decided I'd open-source my solutions.

**My goal with these exercises is not technical perfection or correctness**, so my solutions aren't at all optimized or "scalable" (and in all honesty, are laughably hacky in parts!). Rather, my goal is to simply brush up on my Go skills after having taken good while away from programming. :)

Each solution is packaged as an individual Go module. To run a day, cd into its' directory and run the `main.go` file.

```sh
cd ./advent_of_code_2022/01
go run main.go
```

Also, it likely goes without saying, but spoilers for the 2022 Advent of Code challenges are contained within!
