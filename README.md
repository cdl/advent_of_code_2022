# `advent_of_code_2022`

Participating in [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) this year, and decided I'd open-source
my solutions. My goal with these exercises is not technical perfection, so my solutions aren't at all optimized,
or "scalable" (and in all honesty, are laughably hacky in parts!). Rather, my goal is to simply brush up on my
Go skills after having taken good while away from programming. :)

Each solution is packaged as an individual Go module. To run a day, cd into its' directory and run the `main.go` file.

```sh
cd ./advent_of_code_2022/01
go run main.go
```
